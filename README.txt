Starship Shooter
Introduction
Starship Shooter is a simple arcade-style game created using Python and the Pygame library. This project was developed as part of an exercise to create a game within a limited timeframe, specifically one hour. What makes this project unique is that it was generated with the assistance of an AI language model developed by OpenAI.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project was to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in assisting with rapid game development. By leveraging the AI's ability to generate code and provide guidance, we were able to streamline the development process and create a playable game within a short period. Everything, inclduing the text and the art is made with AI. Some of the art and text has been modified to suit the purpose of the game. 


Features
Player-controlled spaceship
Enemy ships with varying speeds
Multiple types of enemies, including fighters and other enemy ships
Bullets fired by the player to destroy enemies
Score tracking and timer for game duration
Getting Started
To run the game, ensure you have Python and the Pygame library installed on your system. Then, simply execute the main.py script to launch the game.
